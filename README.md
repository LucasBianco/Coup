Actions

A player may choose any action they want and can afford.
Some actions (Character Actions) require influencing characters.
If they choose a Character Action a player must claim that the
required character is one of their face down cards. They can be
telling the truth or bluffing. They do not need to reveal any of their
face down cards unless they are challenged. If they are not challenged
they automatically succeed.
If a player starts their turn with 10 (or more) coins they must launch a
Coup that turn as their only action.

required to launch a Coup.


Character Actions

(If challenged a player must show they influence the relevant character)

that player immediately loses an influence.

Ambassador – Exchange

Exchange cards with the Court. First take 2 random
cards from the Court deck. Choose which, if any, to
exchange with your face down cards. Then return two
cards to the Court deck.


Counteractions


Counteractions can be taken by other players to intervene or block a player’s action.
Counteractions operate like character actions. Players may claim to
influence any of the characters and use their abilities to counteract
another player. They may be telling the truth or bluffing. They do
not need to show any cards unless challenged. Counteractions may be
challenged, but if not challenged they automatically succeed. If an
action is successfully counteracted, the action fails but any coins paid as
the cost of the action remain spent.


Duke – Blocks Foreign Aid

Any player claiming the Duke may counteract and
block a player attempting to collect foreign aid.
The player trying to gain foreign aid receives
no coins that turn.


Contessa – Blocks Assassination

The player who is being assassinated may claim the
Contessa and counteract to block the assassination.
The assassination fails but the fee paid by the player for
the assassin remains spent.


Ambassador/Captain – Blocks Stealing

The player who is being stolen from may claim either
the Ambassador or the Captain and counteract to
block the steal. The player trying to steal receives no
coins that turn.



Challenges


Any action or counteraction using character influence
can be challenged.

Any other player can issue a challenge to a player regardless of whether
they are the involved in the action.

Once an action or counteraction is declared other players must be given
an opportunity to challenge. Once play continues challenges cannot be
retro-actively issued.

If a player is challenged they must prove they had the required
influence by showing the relevant character is one of their face down
cards. If they can’t, or do not wish to, prove it, they lose the challenge.
If they can, the challenger loses.

Whoever loses the challenge immediately loses an influence.

If a player wins a challenge by showing the relevant character card, they
first return that card to the Court deck, re-shuffle the Court deck and
take a random replacement card. (That way they have not lost an influence
and other players do not know the new influence card they have). Then the
action or counteraction is resolved.

If an action is successfully challenged the entire action fails, and any
coins paid as the cost of the action are returned to the player.
